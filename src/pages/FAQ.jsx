        <h3 style={{ color: '#007BFF' }}>What makes KeepCapsule different from other cloud storage?</h3>
        <p>

          Unlike traditional cloud services, KeepCapsule is designed specifically for long-term memory preservation — not everyday file sharing. We focus on simplicity, permanence, and emotional value. Your uploads aren’t buried in folders or forgotten in clutter. Instead, each memory is stored with intention: clearly titled, encrypted, and safely archived in your personal vault for years to come.
          <br /><br />
          Storage is intentionally limited — not to restrict you, but to help you focus on what matters most. It’s about choosing the most meaningful photo, message, or voice note that captures the essence of a memory or a message for loved ones. When every upload counts, each one becomes more precious. This isn’t about quantity — it’s about preserving your legacy and the memories that mattered most to you.
        </p>
        
        <h3 style={{ color: '#007BFF' }}>Is my data safe?</h3>
        <p>
          Absolutely. Your files are encrypted with top-tier security and stored using trusted AWS cloud infrastructure.
        </p>
        
        <h3 style={{ color: '#007BFF' }}>Can I access my uploads anytime?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. You can log in anytime from any device to view, download, or add to your capsule — even years later.
        </p>
  
        <h3 style={{ color: '#007BFF' }}>What happens if I stop paying?</h3>
        <p>
          We’ll send you reminders and give you ample time to retrieve your data. You’ll never lose access without warning.
